		"f":"Feel free to park your car anywhere in old town Roseville. You’ll make your way back near the start! Your quest starts at the viewing platform facing the railroad tracks near Pacific Street Café.",
		"q":"In 1864, a track-laying crew from the Central Pacific Railroad came eastward across the plain from Sacramento, building the western half of the nation’s first transcontinental railroad. They crossed a small rail line (the California Central Railroad) that linked the towns of Lincoln and Folsom, and gave the spot the name of Junction. In 1906, the Southern Pacific Railroad moved its facilities to Roseville where it remains (and is still the largest rail yard on the west coast). Check out the many tracks!<br>Look across the rail yard to the buildings in downtown. There are two buildings dedicated to the telephone companies of Roseville. How many pictures of telephones do you see on the walls facing you?",
		"a":"24",
		"h":"Even the small circles on the brown building are telephones, too!",
		"r":"Right! Good job using those eyes! Up close, they’re a lot bigger! LOL."
	},
	{
		"f":"Walk north on Lincoln Street. At the intersection of Main and Lincoln, the brick building on your right was Roseville’s 1st firehouse location. It was constructed in 1927 to replace a hose cart house. There is a sign with an arrow pointing to a historical sight not far from here. Follow the sign until you reach this (now) museum.",
		"q":"Read the plaque out front near the flag pole. Who was the group that convinced others to make this into a library? (do not use the word “the”, but apostrophes count).",
		"a":"women's improvement club",
		"h":"It was a female group.",
		"r":"Right! Reminds me of Belle doing something like this to make a library! If you want to see more, it’s only open Tuesday-Friday from 10-2, and the second Saturday of the month from 10-2."
	},
	{
		"f":"On the same grounds, there is a clock tower. Go to that spot.",
		"q":"How many more years until the time capsule gets opened?",
		"a":"18",
		"h":"The age when you can vote!",
		"r":"Right! Time capsules are so cool!"
	},
	{
		"f":"Cross the street to the Sierra Vista Bridge and find the plaque located on the bridge.",
		"q":"This bridge was built in 1929 to replace a wooden bridge that connected Historic Old Town to the Sierra Vista subdivision. What is the last name of one of the consulting engineers that is very fitting for the information I just gave you.",
		"a":"woodbridge",
		"h":"It is the name of one of our schools in Roseville City.",
		"r":"Right!"
	},
	{
		"f":"Continue over the bridge on Sierra Vista, turn right on Yosemite so you can cross the railroad tracks to Atlantic Street. Take a right and find the Southern Pacific Locomotive 2252.",
		"q":"Read the plaque. Interesting information, huh? It mentions that this locomotive is a 4-6-0. There are only a few of these left around, but this is one of the oldest. If there were 15 of these engines lined up, how many wheels would there be?",
		"a":"150",
		"h":"Multiply 10 wheels by how many are lined up.",
		"r":"Right! So fun that Roseville has so much train history."
	},
	{
		"f":"Make your way onto Vernon Street and find the Roseville Telephone Museum. ",
		"q":"The Roseville Telephone Company was founded in 1914 by William Doyle and only had 160 subscribers. In the museum, there is a display of the original telephones designed by Alexander Graham Bell, circa 1876. In the window display, there are pictures of some older telephones. If I were to dial the year the company was founded, what 4-letter word could I make using the corresponding letters (can only use letters once)?",
		"a":"whig",
		"h":"The opposing political party to the Tories or use Scrabble Word Finder online.",
		"r":"Right! Good luck visiting this museum. It’s only open on the first Saturday of the month from 10-2."
	},
	{
		"f":"Continue on Vernon just a handful of steps and find the World War II monument dedicated by the Roseville Telephone Foundation.",
		"q":"Your next location is found within the list of names. Use this key (1st number – column, 2nd number – row, 3rd number – letter within the name). Good luck!<br>\*4, 10, 12<br>\*11, 4, 9<br>\*16, 22, 12<br>\*20, 1, 5<br>\*22, 34, 9",
		"a":"royer",
		"h":"I probably made a mistake! So, go to the park that is nearby and is undergoing major construction.",
		"r":"Right! "
	},
	{
		"f":"Find the Veteran’s Memorial Hall. ",
		"q":"In what year was the cornerstone (or start of construction) laid (started)? Think of the name “cornerstone” to help.",
		"h":"Face the building - check out any years on the building itself.",
		"a":"1929",
		"r":"Good one! Keep on going. "
	},
	{
		"f":"Make your way to the South end of the park (near Douglas Blvd.) and find the statue of someone that honors Roseville’s Mexican population. ",
		"q":"Benito Juarez is known as the Father of Independence and the Abe Lincoln of Mexico since he advocated for the abolition of slavery! Cool. Read the plaque to find out some more information. If he was alive today, how old would he be? (assume he has already had his birthday this year)",
		"a":"212",
		"h":"It’s a palindrome.",
		"r":"Perfect math! Good work."
	},
	{
		"f":"Cross the bridge over Dry Creek and turn right on Judah St., then turn right onto Vernon Street. As you are walking, here’s a Fun Fact: the Rock of Roseville Church a few blocks to your left is an accurate re-creation of its predecessor, the Vernon Street School. The Italian-styled school served as the main elementary school for the area’s neighborhoods from 1925-1974. Continue until you reach a building in which you could’ve seen a movie at one time, but is now used for other theater-style events.",
		"q":"The Tower Theater was completed in 1940. It was refurbished in 1955, after a fire. There is a bench with a woman statue right outside. How many dots are on her dress? … JUST KIDDING! That would be an outrageous question. Here’s the real one: How many times does the word “Tower” appear on/in the building?",
		"a":"5",
		"h":"I probably missed one. The answer is 5.",
		"r":"Right!"
	},
	{
		"f":"Find the snail mail location and either go in the front door or peek in if it’s closed.",
		"q":"If I rented a #3 size box for 3 years (paying annually), got two keys to start that I had to pay a deposit for, and I had to change the lock one time, how much did I spend? (don’t need the $ sign in your answer)",
		"a":"832",
		"h":"You got this. Just add again.",
		"r":"Good job. That seems expensive. On your way to the next location, check out the Columbus statue to the right of the post office! :\)"
	},
	{
		"f":"Make your way to the Civic Center. Be careful crossing the street. Stand near the entrance to the building.",
		"q":"You’ll notice that there are granite pillars/columns that line the front of the Civic Center. These pillars represent a walk through time in Roseville’s history. There are 3 granite boulders on the south end of the time wall to represent the Roseville era before locally recorded history, but each pillar represents some part of Roseville’s recorded history. Plans are in the works to make this a living timeline (with plaques and pictures of historic events). Pretty awesome. On each of the pillars are gold-leafed dates in 40-year increments which are hand-chiseled. Find the sum of all the dates. ",
		"a":"20,200",
		"h":"Just add it again. LOL. Perfect vision with an extra zero at the end.",
		"r":"Right! Good work :\)"
	},
	{
		"f":"Exit the Civic Center on the north end and cross the street again. Take a right and head to the bus stop area, which will also be the entrance to the walkway through the tunnel on Washington. Take the walkway through and find the Historic Roseville sign at the intersection of Main and Washington.",
		"q":"Read the plaques. They have interesting information. Anyway, what is the name of the only building left in “old town” from the early years? (IOoOF for the correct format).",
		"a":"International Order of Odd Fellows",
		"h":"Think you can get this one! ",
		"r":"GREAT! Almost there."
